# THE GRAPH NETWORKS ZOO

## requirement:

python3, tensorflow==1.10.0

## some understanding of the model:

GNN: is that you use a RNN to memory every possible step of your input node, the target node is the answer.

GCN: you can see the `pic` folder.

## experiment results:

| task/model | 1-step-gnn | 2-step-gnn |
| babi-4 | 100% | 100% |
| babi-15 | 0% | 100% |
